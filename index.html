            <p> &emsp; Hi! My name is Christopher Williams, and I am an amateur programmer, just getting started into my
            coding quest. I have been taking coding classes since the second semester of my freshmen year at Colorado
            State University, and I have been working on my skills ever since. Specifically, my interest are in Astronomy
            and the creation of Video Games. I am hoping in the future to work at either of these places. I am proficient
            in Java, and I have recently begun learning how to use Python, C++, HTML and JavaScript. If you would like to
            see any of my projects, go to my GitHub!
            </p>
